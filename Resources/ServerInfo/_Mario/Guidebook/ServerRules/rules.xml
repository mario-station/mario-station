  # Server Rules

  Welcome to Mario Station the really awesome highly-anticipated fork of Imp Station, read and agree to these rules

  These rules are lackluster, but I'm sure you can understand the general idea of them, which is all that really matters to me right now.
  These rules are in NO PARTICULAR ORDER, rule 5 shouldn't have lower or higher priority than rule 1.
  
  - 1. [bold]No sexual content, themes, or roleplay[/bold]: People ages 16-17 can play this server, so do not partake in sexual content/themes/roleplay at all

  - 2. [bold]You should be and act 16+[/bold]:
  You should be and act 16 years old or older to play this server, if you are underage, you will be banned until the year after you turn 16
  
  - 3a. [bold]Be respectful[/bold]: Be respectful to other players, and don't take conflicts outside of a round
  
  - 3b. [bold]No discrimination[/bold]: No discrimination in character or out of character
  
  - 4a. [bold]It's roleplay[/bold]: Just play a sensible character and you'll be fine
  
  - 4b. [bold]Only use information your character would know[/bold]: If someone says in LOOC or in a voice chat that they're a thief, your character shouldn't know that
  
  - 4c. [bold]Don't overuse LOOC[/bold]: Using LOOC to talk about some things related to the round might be fine, just don't use it too much and be careful
  
  - 5. [bold]Do your job if possible[/bold]: It'd be annoying if YOU were dying but a doctor was completely ignoring you

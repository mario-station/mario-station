  # Server Rules

  Welcome to Mario Station the really awesome highly-anticipated fork of Imp Station, read and agree to these rules

  These rules are lackluster, but I'm sure you can understand the general idea of them, which is all that really matters to me right now.
  These rules are in NO PARTICULAR ORDER, rule 5 shouldn't have lower or higher priority than rule 1.
  
  1. No sexual content, themes, or roleplay
  People ages 16-17 can play this server, so do not partake in sexual content/themes/roleplay at all

  2. You should be and act 16+
  You should be and act 16 years old or older to play this server, if you are underage, you will be banned until the year after you turn 16
  
  3a. Be respectful
  Be respectful to other players, and don't take conflicts outside of a round
  
  3b. No discrimination
  No discrimination in character or out of character
  
  4a. It's roleplay
  Play a sensible character, don't be too dumb
  
  4b. Only use information your character would know
  If someone says in LOOC or in a voice chat that they're a thief, your character shouldn't know that
  
  4c. Don't overuse LOOC
  Using LOOC to talk about some things related to the round might be fine, just don't use it too much and be careful
  
  5. Do your job if possible
  It'd be annoying if YOU were dying but a doctor was completely ignoring you
